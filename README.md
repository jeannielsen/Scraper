# Scraper

* This assignment was to create an app that scrapes stories from a news outlet and displays them for the user.  Each scraped article should be saved in a database.  The app should scrape and display the headline, url, and a summary as a minimum.  Users should be able to leave comments on articles displayed and revisit them later.  All stored comments should be visible to every user.


### Languages Used

* MongoDB
* Mongoose Documentation
* Cheerio Documentation
* Axios
* Express

###  Take aways

* I was able to get the headline and url scrapped successfully, but was never able to get the summary to print.  Spent far to much time debugging this issue and ran out of time to write the handlebars html.  Also, had issues with the Heroku deployment.  It kept trying to deploy to an old app and several attempts at Stack Overflow suggestions did not help.
